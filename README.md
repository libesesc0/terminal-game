# terminal-game
A little game (more of a demo really) I've made for Linux-based operating systems for learning purposes.
You need `root` privileges to play as it takes input directly from the kernel.

## Controls
These controls are not dependent on your keyboard layout, but the controls listed below are for QWERTY.
- Arrow keys to move;
- Z to shoot;
- ESC to exit.

## Compiling
Hopefully it works on your machine.

`g++ *.cpp`
